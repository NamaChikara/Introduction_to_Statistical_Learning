# Introduction to Statistical Learning

Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR) is a fantastic introductory guide to many classic machine learning concepts and models.  It includes a programming lab with each chapter; this repository contains my work on those labs.  

A PDF of the book is available for free: http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/
